##  (SunBurntTikiGod)

#  Introduction
My name is Charlie, and I'm currently enrolled at Wright State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I'm thrilled to be among great company here on GitHub as I embark on this journey, which I hope will be the rest of my life, as a Computer Engineer.

#  Professional Background
Automotive Expertise
I spent the last 20 years as a Master ASE GM Certified Auto Tech. Over the years, I developed my skills and became a proficient diagnostic service technician for a variety of construction equipment as a member of the IUOE Local 18. I maintained my certifications and eagerly accumulated knowledge as I molded myself to the enigmatic job description of a shop mechanic under the all-encompassing alias of "Operating Engineer." In my return to the automotive industry, I collected certifications for Master Diesel Tech and Master EV/Hybrid Tech.

#  New Beginnings
##  Academic Pursuits
After a shoulder rebuild and with 30 percent of my left knee's medial meniscus missing, I'm back in school to advance my knowledge in Computer Engineering. Always a gamer, computers have been my biggest obsession since I was a kid. I'm excited to see what this industry will evolve into in the coming years and ecstatic to be a part of it.

##  Future Projects
I have a few ideas for projects in the future. These incorporate my knowledge of the automotive industry but are not constrained to its relentless death grip on clumsy user interfaces and ho-hum styling and design. They are projects that will focus more on the performance and customization industry for their demographics. I hope that you will excuse me for not being forthcoming with their exact implementations, in this day and age where ideas appear to manifest on opposite sides of the earth before they've met their inception, we can never be too careful.
