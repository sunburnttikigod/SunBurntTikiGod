##      My name is Charlie, I'm Currently enrolled at Wright State University 
## for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.  I'm happy to be among 
## great company here on GitHub as I begin the journey, that will hopefully be 
## the rest of my life, as a Computer Engineer.
## 
##     I spent the last 20 years of as an Master ASE GM Certified Auto Tech.
## Over the years, I developed my skills and became a proficient diagnostic 
## service ## technician for a variety of construction equipment as a member
## of the IUOE Local 18. I maintained my certifications, and eagerly
## accumulated knowledge as I molded myself to the enigmatic job description 
## of a shop mechanic under the all-encompassing alias of 'Operating Engineer'.  
## In my return to the automotive industry I collected certifications
## for Master Diesel Tech and Master EV/Hybrid Tech.  
##
##     After a shoulder rebuild and 30 percent of my left knee's medial 
## meniscus missing, I'm back in school to advance my knowledge in Computer 
## Engineering.  Always a gamer, computers have been my biggest obsession 
## since i was a kid. I'm excited to see what this industry will evolve into 
## in the coming years, and ecstatic to be able to be part of it.
##
##     I have a few ideas for projects in the future.  These incorporate my 
## knowledge of the automotive industry but are not constrained to its 
## relentless deathgrip on clumbsy user interfaces and hohum styling and design.  
## They are projects that will focus more on the performance and customization 
## industry for their demographics.  I hope that you will excuse me for not 
## being forthcoming with their exact implementations, in this day and age 
## where ideas appear to manifest on opposite sides of the earth before they've 
## met their inception, we can never be to careful.
